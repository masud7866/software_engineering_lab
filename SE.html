    <p>SE also has a large standard library that provides many useful functions and modules for common tasks, such as file I/O, string manipulation, and data structures. This allows programmers to focus on solving problems rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>
    <p>Overall, SE is a versatile and user-friendly programming language that is suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis.</p>
